# ⚽ Footballer Profile Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a predictive model based on individual football player statistics that can classify player profiles and analyze whether their performance is associated with their team’s collective success (championship wins).

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, feature selection, scaling
- **Clustering:** K-means to identify performance-based player groups
- **Classification Models:** Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve

## 💻 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Outcome
Successfully identified player clusters with similar profiles and built models that can predict the likelihood of belonging to a winning team. This approach can support data-driven decision-making in sports analytics.
